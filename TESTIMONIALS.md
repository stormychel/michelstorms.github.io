"Michael stands out as the most exceptional Apple developer I've encountered. Throughout our year-long collaboration, he has consistently met and exceeded the project goals. Notably, his innovative approach brought fresh ideas again and again that significantly enhanced our project's scope and potential. His attention to detail, love for the project and commitment to quality are extraordinary, setting a high standard in our work. Together we developed a macOS app in the upcoming AI space. We will continue our partnership by taking this app to other platforms such as iOS and watchOS later down the line. I wholeheartedly endorse Michael for any projects within the Apple ecosystem, confident in his ability to deliver exceptional results."

## Trevor N.
"Competent and capable mac developer with solid software engineering skills. Takes ownership, including challenges, makes useful suggestions where there are options, and proceeds to take the project to a successful completion. Keywords to take away: "Professional" alone wouldn't do him justice, I would add "Talented", and "A-List". Working with him was a smooth and successful experience. Recommended without reservation."
