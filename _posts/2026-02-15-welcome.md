After years of building apps and working with clients across the Apple ecosystem, I'm starting a blog to share what I've learned along the way.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about the things I encounter daily as a freelance Apple developer:

- **Swift & SwiftUI** — Patterns, tips, and lessons from real-world projects
- **App Architecture** — How I structure apps and why certain decisions matter
- **Developer Life** — The freelance journey, working with clients, and shipping products
- **Behind the Scenes** — Development stories from my own apps like PickDatePlace

## Why Now?

Building software is a craft, and I believe sharing knowledge makes everyone better at it. Whether you're just getting started with Apple development or you've been doing it for years, I hope you'll find something useful here.

Stay tuned for more posts. If you have questions or topics you'd like me to cover, feel free to [reach out](mailto:michelstorms@icloud.com).
